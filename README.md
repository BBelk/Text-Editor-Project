  ## Description
  This is a PWA (progressive web app), a website that can also be downloaded to a users computer. The app itself is a text editor with some coding syntax highlighting mixed in.
 
  ## Usage
  Go to heroku link to use the website through a browser. For local or offline use, you can download the app. Depending on your browser, you can click the "Install" button, or there should be a download looking button in your browser url/search bar. Once downloaded the app will keep the database containing the text content and populate itself.

  Or, to test the whole project, first clone the project into a folder. Navigate to the project in your terminal, then run npm i to install all of the node modules. Then type in "npm run build" in order to build the app/get the webpack packing. After that, type in "npm run start:dev" to get the server and the website up. Finally, in your browser go to "http://localhost:3000/" to use the app or download it.

  ## Technologies
  1. Node.js (for node modules, see below)
  2. Express (server)
  3. Webpack (for the PWA)
  4. Babel (for extended browser support)
  5. Code Mirror (for the text editor code syntax highlights)
